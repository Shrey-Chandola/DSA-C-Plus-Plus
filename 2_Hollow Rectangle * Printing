// Ninja has been given two integers 'M' and ‘N’.
// Now Ninja has to draw a rectangle of height ‘M’ and breadth ‘N’ using the character * such that the * only occurs at the boundaries of the rectangle, and inside of this boundary, there is space only.
// Now, Ninja doesn’t know how to perform this operation.
// You being Ninja's best friend, your task is to help Ninja to solve this problem.
